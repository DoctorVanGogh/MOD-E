# MOD-E

#### This mod is for the game RimWorld. Onces installed, you need to make it the TOPMOST mod in your mod list. Yes, that's right, even above the Core mod.

**Usage:** After installing the mod, try loading a saved game where you have all the mods but in the wrong order or some of them not enabled correctly. A new button will appear in the warning dialog that allows you to fix the mod list. Clicking it will adjust the mod list and restart RimWorld. Now you can load the save game without any errors.
